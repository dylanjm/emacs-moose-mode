#+title: MOOSE-Mode

This is an Emacs major mode for [[https://github.com/idaholab/moose][MOOSE]] input and testing files. It provides syntax-highlighting and that's about it right now.

** Installation

Currently, this package is not yet available on [[https://melpa.org/#/][MELPA]]. In the meantime, you can install =emacs-moose-mode= by cloning this repo and telling your =init.el= file where to find it:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-moose-mode>")
(require 'moose-mode)
#+end_src

Or, if you use [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight package manager]] you can:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package
  :straight (:host github :repo "dylanjm/emacs-moose-mode"))
#+end_src

** Usage

By default, =moose-mode= is set to 'auto-activate' when emacs opens =*.i=, =assessment=, or =test= files.

Also, =moose-mode= defaults to using an indentation-offset of 2. You can change this variable by
putting the following in your =init.el=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load moose-mode
  (setq moose-indent-offset 4))
#+end_src

** Roadmap

Listed in order from /most-practical/ to /strech-goals/.

+ [X] Syntax Highlighting
+ [X] Mode-Specific Indentation
+ [ ] Navigation Functions
+ [ ] Snippets
+ [ ] Autocomplete (Company-Mode integration)
+ [ ] Action-Expansion
+ [ ] Linting

*Note*: Some of these goals may be broken off into separate libraries.
